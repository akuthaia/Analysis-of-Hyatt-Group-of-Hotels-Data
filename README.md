# Analysis-of-Hyatt-Group-of-Hotels-Data
Our team of data analysts worked with the Hyatt group of hotelsâ€™ data to devise major business questions, identify problems and provide solutions to maximise their revenue generation. The vision of this project was to analyse the bulk of data and work towards identifying key factors for increasing the Net Promoter Score (NPS) for the group of hotels.
